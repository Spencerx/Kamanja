This now is the official repository of the models.  We should build up a tree of models for the various industries.
To start there is banking (only Barclay models at this point) and Healthcare (only Edifecs and their clients).

These models are prefixed with the company name of one of Edifecs' clients. The stem of the name describes rule set 
content.  For the most part the models are identical except the <HEADER> information that names Cigna or Blue Cross
California as the model owner/author.  In all other respects the models are very similar if not identical.
