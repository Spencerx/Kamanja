These steps are tested only on a Linux(centos 6.5) VM only

** Install scala 2.10.4
** Install java SDK ( 1.7.1 or greater)
** Install joda-convert-1.6.jar into a local directory(I have put it under $HOME/my_libs)
   This jar file is needed in the classpath for successful compilation of
   scala code generated by model compiler
** In the trunk, run the following command
sbt package
sbt
> project MetadataAPI
> assembly
** Update the config file "RTD/trunk/MetadataAPI/src/main/resources/MetadataAPI.properties"
   to suit your environment.
** Make sure the directory specified by the property "JAR_TARGET_DIR" exists
   (this directory is staging directory to compile scala code generated by model compiler)
** Note that classpath may contain lot of unnecessary jar files, but some of them
   are required to compile scala code generated by model compiler.

** Start MetadataAPI test harness using fat-jar
java -jar RTD/trunk/MetadataAPI/target/scala-2.10/MetadataAPI-1.0
