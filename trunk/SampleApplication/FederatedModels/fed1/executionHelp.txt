1) See that Kafka  You will need to ensure that Zookeeper and Kafka are running before running Fatafat. This does it:
rich@pepper:~/tarballs/kafka/2.10/kafka_2.10-0.8.1.1$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

2) Change directory to the trunk you are planning to use and execute this (after fixing your directory references for install loca and kafka)
rich@pepper:~/github/Bank/RTD/trunk$ easyInstallFatafat.sh /tmp/drdigital ~/github/Bank/RTD/trunk ~/.ivy2 ~/tarballs/kafka/2.10/kafka_2.10-0.8.1.1

3) Copy the edfxN directory to the installation directory's input folder.  Using the /tmp/drdigital location as an example, 
cd /tmp/drdigital
cp -R ~/ligadata/edifecsModels/edfx4 input/

4) Run the ClusterMetadata.sh (after you have fixed all of the references to edfx4 to reflect your installation directory)
bin/ClusterMetadata.sh

5) If there were any kv store setups to do... run the following (after modifying it to reflect your requirement):
input/edfx4/bin/InitKvStores.sh

6) You will have to create the queues needed by kafka just once.  If this has not been accomplished, do so now
bin/CreateQueues.sh

7) Watch things.  Several scripts are available.  Start each one of interest in a separate window:

bin/WatchInputQueue.sh
bin/WatchOutputQueue.sh
bin/WatchStatusQueue.sh

8) Start the engine
bin/StartEngine.sh

9) Push data 
input/edfx4/bin/PushSampleDataToKafka.sh
