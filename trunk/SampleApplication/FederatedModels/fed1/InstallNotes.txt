This directory is designed to be filled out with a model, its udf metadata, messages, containers and then copied
into the ez install directory's input directory.  There is a config file in the metadata folder and some scripts
here in the bin folder that need to be modified for your install location and general setup.

See the general install documentation in the platform doc library for more information.
