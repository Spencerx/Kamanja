This project contains the necessary definitions to preload the metadata cache for the Barclay Bank POC. 
One might consider this an ephemeral that will eventually be replaced by a more robust metadata manager 
mechanism once persistence is in place.  For now it contains all of the definitions needed for the 
BankPOC "from scratch".
